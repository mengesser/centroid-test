# centroid-test
Testing centroiding accuracy by generating a series of simple MIRI PSFs and offsetting them by various known amounts in the Y direction.
Computes and compares centroid algorithm location to known pixel location and reports the rms difference in arcsecs.
Reports the mean offset for each of the F560W, F1000W, F1500W, and F2550W filters.

Nominally report a centroiding accuracy of ~15 mas.
